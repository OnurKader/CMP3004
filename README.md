## Travelling Salesman Problem in C++(20)

**Solving the classic TSP with some popular algorithms like the Exhaustive, O(n!),**
**Greedy Nearest Neighbour, etc. TODO**

## Dependencies

You can build without [SFML](https://sfml-dev.org/),
~~later on there will be a separate file without any graphics, if you remove the
`-DENABLE_SFML` setting in either the `Makefile` or
`Tupfile` whatever build system you choose~~, there are two seperate directories
for that, but the one without visuals doesn't have anything yet

Currently I'm using [{fmt}](https://fmt.dev/) for my iostream needs, if you
don't want to install it, go through the code and replace `fmt::print()` calls

A `C++2a` compatible compiler

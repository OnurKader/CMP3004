# TODO's

## Design

- ~~Draw the US Map and plot the nodes on it~~
- ~~Add a test case (?) a smaller file with fewer points~~
- ~~I messed up the drawing, the y axis is flipped~~
- ~~Change everything from iostream to libfmt~~
- ~~Move Runtime and Constexpr utils to a single file~~
- Repetitive Nearest Neighbour, start from different cities and find the shortest
- Improve the tour by reversing some segments to see if there are crosses
if there are, then they will be resolved

___

## Programming

- Make a graph data structure (?)
  - Circular Linked List maybe? Look at Python code
    Wasn't listening to the lectures
  - ~~Do some C++17 stuff, ask the teacher about C++20~~ C++20 it is
  - Use smart\_pointers and the _**STL** for most things_
- Implement the 3 algorithms first, look for more efficient ones later
  - ~~Exhaustive, Permutation~~
  - ~~Nearest Neighbour~~
  - Coding Trains video, and other resources
  - Genetic Algorithm
  - Jupyter'e bakmak gerek
- Remove all instances of sqrt, constexpr or not, just square everything,
see if you get the same result, if it's the same, just removing sqrt
should result in a big boost in performance
- Kruskal Spanning Tree and Held-Karp

## Notes

Exhaustive Search: Would probably take 1.0935E46 centuries so I won't run it
for that long

NN: Do what? O(nÂ²) with regular all node checks or space partitioning?
